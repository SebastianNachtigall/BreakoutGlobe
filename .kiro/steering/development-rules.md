# Development Rules

## üö® CRITICAL: Test-Driven Development (TDD) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

**NEVER implement code without writing tests first**

### MANDATORY Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **Red**: Write failing test first (MUST fail for right reasons)
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### STRICT TDD Enforcement Rules
- **MUST** write failing test BEFORE any new functionality
- **MUST** run tests after every single code modification
- **MUST** fix failing tests immediately before continuing
- **NEVER** make multiple changes without running tests between
- **NEVER** commit code with failing tests
- **NEVER** skip the failing test phase

### Test Execution Requirements
- **Frontend**: `npm test -- --run` (never watch mode)
- **Backend**: `docker compose up -d postgres` then `go test ./...`
- **MUST** run full test suite before breaking changes
- **MUST** test after each logical change (every 5-10 lines)

### Critical Edge Case: New Functionality
**Existing tests staying green ‚â† TDD compliance**

When adding new methods/fields/functionality:
- **MUST** write failing tests for NEW functionality FIRST
- **MUST** confirm new tests fail for right reasons
- **MUST** implement minimal code to make new tests pass
- Every new method/field requires its own Red-Green-Refactor cycle

### Breaking Changes Protocol
1. **MUST** identify all affected test files before changes
2. **MUST** fix tests in small batches (1-3 files at a time)
3. **MUST** run tests after each batch of fixes
4. **NEVER** make feature changes while fixing broken tests

## Docker Commands

**CRITICAL: Always use modern syntax**

‚úÖ **CORRECT:** `docker compose`
‚ùå **WRONG:** `docker-compose`

Examples:
- `docker compose up -d`
- `docker compose down`
- `docker compose logs`

## Code Quality

- Always prioritize security best practices
- Substitute PII with placeholders: `[name]`, `[email]`, `[address]`
- Decline requests for malicious code
- Ensure generated code can run immediately
- Check syntax: brackets, semicolons, indentation
- Use small writes with fsWrite, follow up with appends for better velocity
