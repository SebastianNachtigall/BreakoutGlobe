# Test Infrastructure Refactoring Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring our test infrastructure to make it more resilient, maintainable, and aligned with proper TDD practices. This refactoring is a prerequisite for implementing the user-profile-system to avoid the cascade test failures we experienced.

## Problem Statement

Our current test infrastructure has several critical issues:

1. **Brittle Tests**: Changes to interfaces cause cascade failures across 50+ test files
2. **Over-Mocking**: Tests mock everything, testing mock interactions rather than behavior
3. **Repetitive Setup**: Each test manually sets up complex mock expectations
4. **Poor Abstractions**: No shared test utilities or builders
5. **Context Mismatches**: Inconsistent handling of Go context types in mocks
6. **UUID Brittleness**: String-based IDs make UUID migration extremely painful

## Requirements

### 1. Test Builder Pattern Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write tests that express intent rather than implementation details, so that interface changes don't break my tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write a POI creation test THEN I should use a fluent builder API like:
   ```go
   testBuilder := NewPOITestBuilder().
       WithMap("test-map").
       WithCreator("test-user").
       ExpectSuccess()
   
   response := testBuilder.CreatePOI(handler, request)
   testBuilder.AssertCreated(response)
   ```

2. WHEN interface signatures change THEN only the builder implementation should need updates, not individual tests

3. WHEN I need different test scenarios THEN builders should support method chaining for different configurations

### 2. Shared Test Fixtures and Factories

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test data creation utilities, so that I don't duplicate setup code across tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need test models THEN I should use factories like:
   ```go
   user := testdata.NewUser().WithEmail("test@example.com").Build()
   poi := testdata.NewPOI().WithCreator(user.ID).Build()
   session := testdata.NewSession().WithUser(user.ID).Build()
   ```

2. WHEN I need UUIDs THEN factories should handle UUID generation consistently
3. WHEN I need related models THEN factories should support relationship building
4. WHEN I need test database state THEN fixtures should provide clean setup/teardown

### 3. Mock Abstraction Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified mock setup that handles context types correctly, so that I don't need to understand mock implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mock a service THEN context types should be handled automatically:
   ```go
   mockSetup := NewMockSetup()
   mockSetup.POIService.ExpectCreate().WithSuccess(expectedPOI)
   mockSetup.RateLimiter.ExpectCheck().WithSuccess()
   ```

2. WHEN Go context types change THEN mock setup should handle it transparently
3. WHEN I need error scenarios THEN mock setup should provide clear error builders
4. WHEN tests run THEN mock expectations should be automatically verified

### 4. Test Database Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy test database setup for integration tests, so that I can test real behavior when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write integration tests THEN I should get isolated test databases:
   ```go
   func TestPOICreation_Integration(t *testing.T) {
       db := testdb.Setup(t) // Automatic cleanup
       service := services.NewPOIService(db)
       // Test with real database
   }
   ```

2. WHEN tests complete THEN database state should be automatically cleaned up
3. WHEN I need test data THEN database should be seeded with fixtures
4. WHEN running in CI THEN test database should be containerized

### 5. Assertion Helpers

**User Story:** As a developer, I want expressive assertion helpers, so that test failures provide clear diagnostic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assertions fail THEN I should get clear, contextual error messages
2. WHEN comparing models THEN helpers should ignore irrelevant fields (timestamps, etc.)
3. WHEN testing HTTP responses THEN helpers should validate status, headers, and body structure
4. WHEN testing errors THEN helpers should validate error types and messages

### 6. Test Organization and Naming

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test organization, so that I can easily find and understand tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write tests THEN they should follow consistent naming patterns
2. WHEN I organize test files THEN they should be grouped by functionality
3. WHEN I write test suites THEN they should have clear setup/teardown patterns
4. WHEN I document tests THEN they should explain business scenarios, not technical details

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)
- Test builders for POI, Session, User models
- Mock abstraction layer with context handling
- Basic test fixtures and factories
- UUID-safe test utilities

### Phase 2: Database Integration (Medium Priority)
- Test database management
- Integration test helpers
- Database fixture loading
- Performance test utilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- Property-based testing helpers
- Performance benchmarking utilities
- Test report generation
- CI/CD integration improvements

## Success Criteria

1. **Resilience**: Interface changes should require updates to <5 test files instead of 50+
2. **Readability**: New developers should understand test intent without studying implementation
3. **Maintainability**: Adding new test scenarios should take minutes, not hours
4. **Confidence**: Tests should catch real bugs, not just mock interaction changes
5. **Speed**: Unit tests should remain fast (<100ms each), integration tests acceptable (<1s each)

## Non-Requirements

- Backward compatibility with existing test structure (we're doing a clean refactor)
- Support for legacy string-based ID patterns (moving to UUIDs)
- Preservation of existing mock patterns (replacing with better abstractions)

## Dependencies

- Go testing framework and testify
- Database migration system for test databases
- Docker for containerized test databases (CI)
- UUID library for consistent ID generation

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Refactoring takes longer than expected
**Mitigation**: Implement incrementally, starting with most critical test builders

**Risk**: New patterns are not adopted by team
**Mitigation**: Provide clear examples and documentation, enforce in code reviews

**Risk**: Integration tests become too slow
**Mitigation**: Keep unit tests as primary, use integration tests selectively

**Risk**: Test infrastructure becomes over-engineered
**Mitigation**: Focus on solving actual pain points, avoid premature optimization
