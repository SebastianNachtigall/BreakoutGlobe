# POI Creation Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the incomplete POI (Point of Interest) creation functionality in BreakoutGlobe. Currently, users can right-click on the map to show a context menu and open the POI creation modal, but the actual POI creation fails due to missing API integration, interface mismatches, and incomplete data flow between frontend and backend.

The goal is to complete the POI creation workflow so users can successfully create POIs that persist to the database and appear on the map for all users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix POI Creation Modal Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully submit the POI creation form so that my POI is created and appears on the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on the map THEN the context menu SHALL appear with "Create POI" option
2. WHEN I click "Create POI" THEN the POI creation modal SHALL open with the correct map coordinates pre-filled
3. WHEN I fill out the POI form with valid data and click "Create POI" THEN the form submission SHALL be handled correctly
4. WHEN the POI creation is in progress THEN the modal SHALL show loading state and disable form controls
5. WHEN POI creation succeeds THEN the modal SHALL close and the new POI SHALL appear on the map
6. WHEN POI creation fails THEN an error message SHALL be displayed to the user

### Requirement 2: Complete API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API functions for POI operations so that the frontend can communicate with the backend effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POI creation is triggered THEN the system SHALL call the backend POST /api/pois endpoint
2. WHEN creating a POI THEN the request SHALL include all required fields (mapId, name, description, position, createdBy, maxParticipants)
3. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the response SHALL contain the created POI with server-generated ID
4. WHEN the API call fails THEN appropriate error handling SHALL occur with user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN POI data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide functions to fetch, update, and delete POIs

### Requirement 3: Proper Data Mapping and Validation

**User Story:** As a system, I want to ensure POI data is correctly mapped between frontend and backend so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending POI data to backend THEN the frontend SHALL map form data to backend API format correctly
2. WHEN receiving POI data from backend THEN the frontend SHALL transform it to the expected frontend format
3. WHEN creating a POI THEN the system SHALL use the current user's profile ID as createdBy field
4. WHEN creating a POI THEN the system SHALL use the correct mapId for the current map context
5. WHEN validating POI data THEN both frontend and backend validation SHALL be consistent

### Requirement 4: Optimistic Updates and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when creating POIs so that the interface feels responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit a POI creation form THEN the POI SHALL appear on the map immediately (optimistic update)
2. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the optimistic POI SHALL be replaced with the server response
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the optimistic POI SHALL be removed and an error SHALL be shown
4. WHEN POIs are updated THEN all connected users SHALL see the changes in real-time
5. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN POIs SHALL persist and be loaded from the server

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about POI creation status so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POI creation fails due to network issues THEN a retry option SHALL be provided
2. WHEN POI creation fails due to validation errors THEN specific field errors SHALL be highlighted
3. WHEN POI creation fails due to server errors THEN a generic error message SHALL be shown
4. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN appropriate authentication prompts SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the user SHALL be informed about the limitation and retry timing

### Requirement 6: Integration Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests to ensure POI creation works reliably across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POI creation is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL cover all API functions
2. WHEN POI creation is implemented THEN integration tests SHALL cover the complete workflow
3. WHEN POI creation is implemented THEN error scenarios SHALL be tested (network failures, validation errors, etc.)
4. WHEN POI creation is implemented THEN the functionality SHALL work with both real backend and mock data
5. WHEN POI creation is implemented THEN performance SHALL be acceptable for typical usage patterns
