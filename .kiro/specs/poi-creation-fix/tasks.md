# Implementation Summary

### Root Cause Identified and Fixed
The POI creation persistence problem was caused by the server using mock handlers instead of database-backed handlers. The issue was not in the frontend code, but in the backend infrastructure setup.

### What Was Implemented
1. **Database Migration Fix**: Manually ran missing database migrations to create `pois`, `maps`, and `sessions` tables
2. **Redis Integration**: Added Redis client setup and connection to the server
3. **Complete Service Stack**: Wired up the full POI service infrastructure:
   - POI Repository for database operations
   - POI Participants Service for Redis-based membership tracking
   - PubSub Service for real-time events
   - POI Service for business logic
   - POI Handler for HTTP endpoints
4. **Handler Replacement**: Replaced mock POI endpoints with proper database-backed handlers
5. **Data Validation**: Added proper foreign key constraints and duplicate location checking

### Verification Results
✅ **POI Creation**: Successfully creates POIs and persists to database  
✅ **POI Retrieval**: Successfully retrieves POIs from database  
✅ **Data Validation**: Foreign key constraints working (requires valid map and user)  
✅ **Business Logic**: Duplicate location checking working (prevents POIs too close together)  
✅ **Database Persistence**: POIs are properly stored with all fields  
✅ **API Responses**: Proper JSON responses with generated IDs and timestamps  

### Test Results
- Created test POIs that persist to database
- Verified POIs are visible across sessions
- Confirmed duplicate location validation (100m minimum distance)
- Validated foreign key constraints for maps and users
- Multiple POI creation and retrieval working correctly

The POI creation persistence problem is **completely resolved**!
