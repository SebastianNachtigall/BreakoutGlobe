# Enhanced POI Interaction - Requirements

## Problem Statement

The POI details panel displays basic information when clicking on POIs, but lacks the rich interaction features needed for meaningful collaboration. Users need to see detailed participant information, discussion statistics, and have intuitive join/leave behavior that matches natural user expectations.

## User Story

**As a user, I want to see comprehensive POI information including participants and discussion statistics, and have intuitive interaction patterns for joining and leaving POIs.**

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: POI Details Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see comprehensive information when I click on a POI, so that I can understand the current activity and decide whether to join.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a POI THEN the system SHALL display a details panel with POI name and description
2. WHEN the POI details panel opens THEN the system SHALL show the current number of participants
3. WHEN the POI details panel opens THEN the system SHALL display the username of each user currently in the POI
4. WHEN 2 or more people are in the POI THEN the system SHALL show the time elapsed since the discussion started
5. WHEN only 0-1 people are in the POI THEN the system SHALL show "No active discussion" or similar message

### Requirement 2: POI Join Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to join a POI by clicking a join button, so that I can participate in the location-based discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a POI they haven't joined THEN the system SHALL display a "Join" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Join" button THEN the system SHALL add them to the POI participants immediately
3. WHEN a user joins a POI THEN the system SHALL update the participant list and count for all users in real-time
4. WHEN a user joins a POI THEN the system SHALL start or continue the discussion timer if 2+ people are present
5. IF a POI is at maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL disable the join button and show "Full (10/10)" status
6. WHEN a user successfully joins THEN the system SHALL remove the join button (no explicit leave button needed)

### Requirement 3: Automatic Leave Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to automatically leave a POI when I interact with other parts of the map, so that the interaction feels natural and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a different POI THEN the system SHALL automatically leave their current POI and join the new one
2. WHEN a user clicks anywhere on the map (not on a POI) THEN the system SHALL leave their current POI and close the details panel
3. WHEN a user leaves a POI THEN the system SHALL update the participant list and count for all users in real-time
4. WHEN a user leaves a POI and only 1 person remains THEN the system SHALL pause the discussion timer
5. WHEN a user leaves a POI and 0 people remain THEN the system SHALL reset the discussion timer

### Requirement 4: Discussion Timer and Statistics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see how long a discussion has been active in a POI, so that I can gauge the level of engagement and activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 2 or more users are in a POI THEN the system SHALL start tracking discussion time
2. WHEN the discussion timer is active THEN the system SHALL display "Discussion active for: X minutes Y seconds"
3. WHEN participants drop below 2 people THEN the system SHALL pause the timer but maintain the elapsed time
4. WHEN participants return to 2+ people THEN the system SHALL resume the timer from where it paused
5. WHEN all participants leave a POI THEN the system SHALL reset the discussion timer to zero
6. WHEN displaying the timer THEN the system SHALL update it in real-time every second for all viewers

### Requirement 5: Real-time Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates of POI activity, so that I have accurate information about ongoing discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user joins a POI THEN the system SHALL update the participant list and count in real-time for all users
2. WHEN another user leaves a POI THEN the system SHALL update the participant list and count in real-time for all users
3. WHEN discussion timer changes THEN the system SHALL synchronize the timer display across all users viewing that POI
4. WHEN a POI reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL disable join buttons for all users in real-time
5. WHEN a POI has space available again THEN the system SHALL enable join buttons for all users in real-time

### Requirement 6: User Session Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to track my POI participation across browser sessions, so that my participation state is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins a POI THEN the system SHALL associate the user's session with that POI
2. WHEN a user refreshes the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their POI participation status and show correct UI state
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them from all POIs and update other users
4. WHEN displaying POI details THEN the system SHALL show the correct join button state based on user's current participation
5. WHEN a user reconnects after disconnection THEN the system SHALL restore their POI participation state

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration
- Frontend must make HTTP requests to existing backend endpoints: `/api/pois/:id/join` and `/api/pois/:id/leave`
- Requests must include proper session identification
- Error handling for network failures and server errors

### State Management
- POI store must track user's joined POIs
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Real-time synchronization via WebSocket events

### User Experience
- Immediate visual feedback on button clicks
- Loading states during API requests
- Clear error messages for failures
- Accessibility compliance for button states

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ POI details panel shows participant count, usernames, and discussion timer
2. ✅ Join button successfully adds user to POI and updates all displays in real-time
3. ✅ Automatic leave functionality works when clicking other POIs or map areas
4. ✅ Discussion timer accurately tracks active discussion time (2+ participants)
5. ✅ Real-time synchronization works across multiple browser sessions
6. ✅ POI capacity limits are enforced and displayed correctly
7. ✅ Session persistence maintains POI participation across refreshes
8. ✅ Intuitive user experience with no explicit leave buttons needed

## Out of Scope

- Authentication/authorization (using existing session-based approach)
- POI creation/deletion functionality (already working)
- Map visualization changes (focus on button functionality only)
- Advanced POI features (video calls, etc.)
