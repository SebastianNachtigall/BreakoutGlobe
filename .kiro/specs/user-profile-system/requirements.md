# User Profile & Account System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive user profile and account system that replaces the current anonymous session model. Users will be able to create guest profiles or full accounts, with different capabilities and permissions based on their account type.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Guest Profile Creation

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create a guest profile with my name and optional avatar so that other users can identify me on the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a map without an existing profile THEN the system SHALL display a profile creation modal
2. WHEN creating a guest profile THEN the system SHALL require a display name (3-50 characters)
3. WHEN creating a guest profile THEN the system SHALL allow optional avatar image upload (max 2MB, JPG/PNG)
4. WHEN creating a guest profile THEN the system SHALL allow optional "About Me" text (max 500 characters)
5. WHEN a guest profile is created THEN the system SHALL store it in browser localStorage
6. WHEN a guest profile is created THEN the system SHALL sync it to the backend database
7. WHEN a guest profile exists THEN the system SHALL automatically use it for map access

### Requirement 2: Full Account Creation

**User Story:** As a user with a guest profile, I want to upgrade to a full account with email and password so that I can access my profile from any device and have additional permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a guest profile THEN the system SHALL provide an option to upgrade to a full account
2. WHEN creating a full account THEN the system SHALL require a valid email address
3. WHEN creating a full account THEN the system SHALL require a secure password (min 8 chars, mixed case, numbers)
4. WHEN creating a full account THEN the system SHALL preserve existing profile data (name, avatar, about me)
5. WHEN a full account is created THEN the system SHALL send email verification
6. WHEN a full account is verified THEN the system SHALL enable cross-device profile access
7. WHEN a full account exists THEN the system SHALL support role assignment (user, admin, superadmin)

### Requirement 3: Profile-Based Avatar Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see other users' names and avatar images on the map so that I can identify who is who during collaborative sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has an avatar image THEN the system SHALL display it as their map marker
2. WHEN a user has no avatar image THEN the system SHALL display a default avatar with their initials
3. WHEN hovering over a user's avatar THEN the system SHALL show their display name
4. WHEN clicking on a user's avatar THEN the system SHALL show their profile card (name, avatar, about me)
5. WHEN users move on the map THEN their avatar SHALL move in real-time for all other users
6. WHEN a user updates their avatar THEN it SHALL update in real-time for all connected users

### Requirement 4: Access Control & Authentication

**User Story:** As a system, I want to ensure only users with profiles can access maps and enforce appropriate permissions based on account type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user without a profile accesses a map THEN the system SHALL redirect to profile creation
2. WHEN a user with a guest profile accesses a map THEN the system SHALL allow basic map functionality
3. WHEN a user with a full account accesses a map THEN the system SHALL enable all features based on their role
4. WHEN a user has admin role THEN the system SHALL allow map management (create/edit POIs, moderate users)
5. WHEN a user has superadmin role THEN the system SHALL allow user management and system administration
6. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication (full accounts only)

### Requirement 5: Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update my profile information so that I can keep my details current and change my appearance on the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has a guest profile THEN they SHALL be able to change their avatar image only
2. WHEN a user has a guest profile THEN they SHALL NOT be able to change their display name
3. WHEN a user has a full account THEN they SHALL be able to change avatar, about me, email, and password
4. WHEN a user changes their avatar THEN it SHALL update immediately on the map for all users
5. WHEN a user changes their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification
6. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL require current password confirmation
7. WHEN profile changes are saved THEN they SHALL sync to both localStorage and backend

### Requirement 6: User Management (Superadmin)

**User Story:** As a superadmin, I want to manage all users in the system so that I can moderate behavior and assign appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a superadmin accesses user management THEN the system SHALL display all registered users
2. WHEN viewing user list THEN the system SHALL show name, email (if full account), account type, role, and last active

4. WHEN a superadmin manages a user THEN they SHALL be able to change user roles
5. WHEN a superadmin manages a user THEN they SHALL be able to disable/enable accounts
6. WHEN a superadmin manages a user THEN they SHALL be able to reset passwords (full accounts)
7. WHEN user management actions are performed THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence & Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to be reliably stored and synchronized so that I don't lose my information and can access it from different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest profile is created THEN it SHALL be stored in browser localStorage as primary storage
2. WHEN a guest profile is created THEN it SHALL be backed up to the backend database
3. WHEN a full account is created THEN the backend database SHALL become the primary storage
4. WHEN profile data changes THEN it SHALL sync between localStorage and backend within 5 seconds

6. WHEN a user accesses from a new device THEN guest profiles SHALL require recreation
7. WHEN offline THEN guest profile changes SHALL queue for sync when connection resumes

### Requirement 8: Multi-Map Support & User Isolation
