# WebVideo POC Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a WebVideo Proof of Concept (POC) spike to explore video calling functionality when users click on other user avatars in BreakoutGlobe. This is an experimental spike to understand technical requirements and challenges before implementing a production-ready solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Avatar Click Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on another user's avatar to initiate a video call, so that I can have face-to-face conversations with other participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on another user's avatar THEN the system SHALL display a "calling..." modal
2. WHEN a user clicks on their own avatar THEN the system SHALL NOT initiate a call
3. WHEN a user clicks on an avatar THEN the system SHALL identify the target user correctly
4. WHEN no other users are present THEN avatar clicks SHALL be disabled or show appropriate feedback

### Requirement 2: Call Signaling

**User Story:** As a user receiving a call, I want to be notified of incoming video calls, so that I can choose to accept or reject them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a call is initiated THEN the target user SHALL receive an "incoming call" notification
2. WHEN a user receives a call THEN they SHALL see caller information (name, avatar)
3. WHEN a user receives a call THEN they SHALL have options to accept or reject
4. WHEN a call is rejected THEN both users SHALL return to normal state
5. WHEN a call times out THEN the system SHALL automatically end the call attempt

### Requirement 3: Basic WebRTC Connection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to establish a video connection when I accept a call, so that I can see and hear the other participant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a call is accepted THEN the system SHALL establish a WebRTC peer connection
2. WHEN connected THEN both users SHALL see their own video (local stream)
3. WHEN connected THEN both users SHALL see the other user's video (remote stream)
4. WHEN connected THEN both users SHALL hear audio from the other participant
5. IF camera/microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Call Controls

**User Story:** As a user in a video call, I want basic controls to manage my audio and video, so that I can control my participation in the call.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in a call THEN users SHALL be able to mute/unmute their microphone
2. WHEN in a call THEN users SHALL be able to turn their camera on/off
3. WHEN in a call THEN users SHALL be able to end the call
4. WHEN a call is ended THEN both users SHALL return to the normal map view
5. WHEN one user ends the call THEN the other user SHALL be notified

### Requirement 5: Call State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the current call state, so that I understand what's happening during the call process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a call THEN the system SHALL show "calling..." state
2. WHEN receiving a call THEN the system SHALL show "incoming call" state
3. WHEN call is connecting THEN the system SHALL show "connecting..." state
4. WHEN call is active THEN the system SHALL show "connected" state with video
5. WHEN call ends THEN the system SHALL show "call ended" state briefly before returning to normal

### Requirement 6: Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand when video calls fail, so that I can take appropriate action or try again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebRTC connection fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message
2. WHEN camera/microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL explain the issue
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection or graceful degradation
4. WHEN the other user is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show "user unavailable" message
5. WHEN technical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log details for debugging

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing System

**User Story:** As a user, I want video calls to work seamlessly with the existing BreakoutGlobe interface, so that it feels like a natural extension of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video call is active THEN the map SHALL remain visible in the background
2. WHEN a video call ends THEN users SHALL return to their previous map state
3. WHEN in a video call THEN other BreakoutGlobe features SHALL remain accessible
4. WHEN receiving a call THEN the notification SHALL not interfere with map interactions
5. WHEN multiple users are present THEN video calls SHALL not affect other users' experience
