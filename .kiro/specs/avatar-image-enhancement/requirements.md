# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user avatar upload experience by adding image preview, client-side resizing, and lightweight editing capabilities. The enhancement focuses on improving the onboarding flow while maintaining backend compatibility by handling all image processing on the frontend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user during onboarding, I want to see a preview of my selected avatar image before uploading, so that I can confirm it looks correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an image file in the onboarding modal THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the selected image
2. WHEN the image preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the image in a circular crop preview matching the final avatar appearance
3. IF no image is selected THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder indicating where the preview will appear
4. WHEN the user changes their image selection THEN the system SHALL immediately update the preview to reflect the new selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user uploading an avatar, I want to upload larger image files (up to 10MB), so that I can use high-quality photos without worrying about file size restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL accept files up to 10MB in size
2. IF a user selects a file larger than 10MB THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the file size limit
3. WHEN a valid image file is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically resize it to optimize for avatar display
4. WHEN resizing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the original image aspect ratio during processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user uploading an avatar, I want the image to be automatically resized on my device, so that uploads are fast and the backend doesn't need to handle large files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is selected for upload THEN the system SHALL resize the image on the client-side before sending to the server
2. WHEN resizing occurs THEN the system SHALL reduce the image to appropriate dimensions for avatar display (maximum 512x512 pixels)
3. WHEN the resized image is created THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable image quality for avatar purposes
4. WHEN the resize process completes THEN the system SHALL use the resized image for both preview and upload

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user uploading an avatar, I want to crop and adjust my image before uploading, so that I can control how my avatar appears.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an image THEN the system SHALL provide a lightweight editing interface for cropping
2. WHEN the editing interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select a square crop area from their image
3. WHEN the user adjusts the crop area THEN the system SHALL update the circular preview in real-time
4. WHEN the user confirms their crop selection THEN the system SHALL apply the crop to the image before resizing and upload
5. WHEN the editing interface is shown THEN the system SHALL provide clear controls to confirm or cancel the crop operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user in the avatar editing interface, I want to see how my cropped image will look as a circular avatar, so that I can make informed cropping decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the crop editing interface is active THEN the system SHALL display a circular preview of the cropped area
2. WHEN the user adjusts the crop selection THEN the system SHALL update the circular preview in real-time
3. WHEN the circular preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the preview at the same size as avatars appear in the application
4. WHEN the user moves or resizes the crop area THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in the circular preview

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user completing avatar upload, I want the process to work seamlessly with the existing backend, so that my avatar is saved and displayed correctly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the final processed image is ready for upload THEN the system SHALL use the existing avatar upload API endpoints
2. WHEN the upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the user's profile with the new avatar
3. WHEN the avatar is saved THEN the system SHALL display the new avatar in all relevant UI components
4. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and allow the user to retry
