# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BreakoutGlobe Foundation is the core MVP that establishes the essential infrastructure for an interactive world map platform with avatar-based user presence and basic Points of Interest (POI) functionality. This foundation provides the technical architecture and basic user experience that will support future video conferencing, workshop management, and gamification features.

The system allows users to join without authentication, place avatars on a real-world map, move around with click-to-move functionality, create and interact with POIs, and see other users in real-time through WebSocket communication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access an interactive world map without needing to register or authenticate, so that I can quickly join and start exploring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display an interactive world map without requiring login
2. WHEN a user accesses the map THEN the system SHALL automatically create a temporary session for the user
3. WHEN a user refreshes the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their session and avatar position
4. IF a user is inactive for more than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL expire their session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to place and move my avatar on the map, so that I can navigate the virtual space and show my presence to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first joins THEN the system SHALL allow them to place their avatar anywhere on the map
2. WHEN a user clicks on a location on the map THEN the system SHALL move their avatar to that position
3. WHEN an avatar moves THEN the system SHALL display smooth movement animation
4. WHEN an avatar is placed or moved THEN the system SHALL broadcast the position to all other connected users
5. WHEN multiple users are present THEN the system SHALL display all avatars simultaneously without overlap conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and interact with Points of Interest (POIs) on the map, so that I can establish meeting spaces and see where activities are happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on the map THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with "Create POI" option
2. WHEN a user creates a POI THEN the system SHALL require a name and optional description
3. WHEN a POI is created THEN the system SHALL display it as a visible marker on the map for all users
4. WHEN a user clicks on a POI THEN the system SHALL show POI details and current participant count
5. WHEN a user joins a POI THEN the system SHALL increment the participant count and show the user as "in POI"
6. IF a POI has 10 participants THEN the system SHALL prevent additional users from joining
7. WHEN a user leaves a POI THEN the system SHALL decrement the participant count

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates of other users' activities and POI changes, so that I can interact with a live, dynamic environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user moves their avatar THEN the system SHALL broadcast the position update to all connected clients within 200ms
2. WHEN a POI is created, modified, or deleted THEN the system SHALL synchronize the change across all connected clients
3. WHEN a user joins or leaves a POI THEN the system SHALL update participant counts in real-time for all users
4. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL remove their avatar from other users' views within 5 seconds
5. IF the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection every 3 seconds
6. WHEN reconnection succeeds THEN the system SHALL resynchronize the user's state with the current map state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can have a smooth experience across different devices and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the map within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection
2. WHEN a user performs any action THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback within 100ms
3. WHEN the map is displayed THEN the system SHALL support smooth zooming and panning on both desktop and mobile devices
4. WHEN 50+ users are connected simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
5. IF network latency exceeds 500ms THEN the system SHALL display a connection quality indicator

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be containerized and easily deployable, so that I can manage infrastructure efficiently and scale as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for all components
2. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the database schema automatically
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL serve the frontend through a production-ready web server
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of the backend services
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for all services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with timestamp, user context, and stack trace
2. WHEN a user experiences an error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the application
5. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate input and return specific error messages
