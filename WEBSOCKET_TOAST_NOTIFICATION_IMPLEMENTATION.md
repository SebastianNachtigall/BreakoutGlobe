# WebSocket Connection Status - Toast Notification Implementation

## Summary

Successfully replaced the persistent WebSocket connection status displays with toast notifications that appear only when the connection state changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Toast Store (`frontend/src/stores/toastStore.ts`)
- New Zustand store for managing toast notifications globally
- Methods: `addToast()`, `removeToast()`, `clearToasts()`
- Toast data structure includes: id, message, type, duration

### 2. Updated App.tsx

#### Imports
- Removed: `ConnectionStatus` component import
- Added: `ToastContainer` component import
- Added: `toastStore` import

#### Connection Status Handling
Updated both WebSocket initialization points to show toasts on connection state changes:

**Toast Triggers:**
- **Disconnected** → Warning toast: "Connection lost. Reconnecting..." (5s duration)
- **Reconnecting** → Info toast: "Reconnecting to server..." (3s duration)
- **Connected** (after disconnect) → Success toast: "Connected!" (3s duration)

**Smart Logic:**
- Skips toast on initial connection to avoid noise
- Only shows toasts when transitioning between states
- Uses previous status to determine if reconnection was successful

#### UI Changes
- **Removed:** `<ConnectionStatus>` component from header (top-right)
- **Removed:** Connection-dependent text from status bar
- **Added:** `<ToastContainer>` component at the end of the render tree
- **Simplified:** Status bar text is now static: "Click avatar for video call • Right-click to create POI"

### 3. Added Toast CSS Styles (`frontend/src/index.css`)

**Features:**
- Positioned at top-right by default (configurable)
- Smooth slide-in animation
- Color-coded by type (success: green, error: red, warning: orange, info: blue)
- Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
- Manual dismiss button
- Responsive design with max-width
- High z-index (9999) to appear above all content

**Supported Positions:**
- top-right, top-left, top-center
- bottom-right, bottom-left, bottom-center

## Benefits

1. **Less Visual Clutter** - Status only shown when it changes
2. **More Attention-Grabbing** - Users are notified immediately of connection issues
3. **Cleaner UI** - No persistent status indicator when everything is working
4. **Better UX** - Users get positive feedback when reconnection succeeds
5. **Consistent Pattern** - Uses the same toast system that can be reused for other notifications

## Testing

Build completed successfully with no errors related to the toast implementation.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add unit tests for `toastStore`
2. Add integration tests for toast notifications on connection changes
3. Consider adding a small connection indicator dot in the header for persistent status (optional)
4. Add toast notifications for other events (POI created, user joined, etc.)
5. Add sound notifications for critical connection issues (optional)
