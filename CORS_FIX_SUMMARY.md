# CORS Fix Summary

## Problem
Railway production deployment was experiencing CORS errors:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://backend-production-6f67.up.railway.app/api/...' 
from origin 'https://breakout-globe.up.railway.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

This was affecting:
- Session heartbeat requests (`/api/maps/default-map/sessions`)
- POI join/leave operations (`/api/pois/{id}/join`, `/api/pois/{id}/leave`)

## Root Cause
The CORS middleware configuration was missing explicit preflight request handling parameters:
- No `MaxAge` configuration for caching preflight OPTIONS requests
- No `ExposeHeaders` configuration

This caused the browser's preflight OPTIONS requests to fail, blocking subsequent actual requests.

## Solution
Enhanced the CORS configuration in `backend/internal/server/server.go`:

```go
// CORS middleware with explicit preflight handling
router.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
    AllowOrigins:     []string{
        "http://localhost:3000",                                    // Local development
        "https://frontend-production-0050.up.railway.app",         // Railway production (old)
        "https://breakout-globe.up.railway.app",                   // Railway production (new)
    },
    AllowMethods:     []string{"GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"},
    AllowHeaders:     []string{"Origin", "Content-Type", "Accept", "Authorization", "X-User-ID"},
    ExposeHeaders:    []string{"Content-Length"},
    AllowCredentials: true,
    MaxAge:           12 * time.Hour, // Cache preflight requests for 12 hours
}))
```

### Key Changes
1. **Added `MaxAge: 12 * time.Hour`**: Instructs browsers to cache preflight responses for 12 hours, reducing preflight request overhead
2. **Added `ExposeHeaders: []string{"Content-Length"}`**: Explicitly declares which response headers can be accessed by the frontend

## Testing
- All backend server tests pass
- CORS configuration properly handles preflight OPTIONS requests
- Production deployment should now work correctly

## Deployment
After deploying this fix to Railway:
1. The backend will properly respond to preflight OPTIONS requests
2. Browsers will cache the CORS preflight response for 12 hours
3. Session heartbeats and POI operations will work correctly
