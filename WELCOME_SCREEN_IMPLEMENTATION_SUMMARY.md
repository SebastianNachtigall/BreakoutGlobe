# Welcome Screen Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a welcome screen that appears before the user creation modal, matching the provided design specifications.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Welcome Screen Component (`frontend/src/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`)
- **Full-screen overlay**: Uses `fixed inset-0` with high z-index (`z-[9999]`)
- **Design elements**:
  - **Responsive "Welcome" title** (text-4xl on mobile, text-5xl on tablet, text-6xl on desktop)
  - BreakoutGlobe.svg illustration displaying the professional map design
  - **Mobile-optimized image sizing** (max-w-xs on mobile, max-w-sm on larger screens)
  - Clean white background with responsive border radius
  - Professional SVG artwork showing POIs and video call functionality
  - **Responsive descriptive text** with appropriate sizing for each device
  - **Touch-optimized "Get Started" button** with proper padding and touch targets

### 2. App.tsx Integration
- **New state management**:
  - Added `showWelcome` state to control welcome screen visibility
  - Added `handleGetStarted` callback to transition from welcome to profile creation
- **Flow modification**:
  - Welcome screen now shows first for new users
  - Profile creation modal shows after clicking "Get Started"
  - Existing users skip the welcome screen entirely

### 3. User Flow
1. **New users**: Welcome Screen → Profile Creation Modal → Main App
2. **Existing users**: Loading → Main App (skips welcome screen)
3. **Stale profile cleanup**: Welcome Screen → Profile Creation Modal → Main App

### 4. Testing
- **Component tests**: `WelcomeScreen.test.tsx` - 5 passing tests
- **Manual verification**: `welcome-screen-manual-verification.test.tsx` - 5 passing tests
- **Build verification**: Successfully builds without errors
