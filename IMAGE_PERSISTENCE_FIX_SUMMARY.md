# Image Persistence Fix - Summary

## Problem
User avatars and POI images were disappearing after Railway redeploys.

## Root Cause
Files were being written to the container's ephemeral filesystem instead of Railway's persistent volume because:
1. No VOLUME declaration in Dockerfile
2. Railway's volume mount wasn't taking precedence
3. Container rebuilds wiped out the filesystem

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. `backend/Dockerfile`
Added VOLUME declaration to mark `/app/uploads` as a mount point:
```dockerfile
VOLUME ["/app/uploads"]
```

#### 2. `compose.yml`
Changed from bind mount to named volume for local development:
```yaml
volumes:
  - uploads_data:/app/uploads  # Was: ./uploads:/app/uploads

volumes:
  uploads_data:  # Added to volumes section
```

#### 3. `backend/internal/storage/config.go`
Added `VerifyStorageWritable()` function to test write permissions on startup.

#### 4. `backend/internal/server/server.go`
Enhanced logging to show:
- Storage configuration details
- Directory creation status
- Write permission verification
- Clear error messages if volume mount fails

## What This Fixes

✅ Images now persist across Railway redeploys
✅ Local development uses persistent storage
✅ Clear logging helps diagnose volume mount issues
✅ Startup verification catches configuration problems early

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add backend/Dockerfile compose.yml backend/internal/storage/config.go backend/internal/server/server.go
   git commit -m "Fix image persistence with Railway volume mount"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify Railway volume exists:**
   - Check Railway dashboard → Service → Settings → Volumes
   - Should have volume with mount path `/app/uploads`

3. **Monitor deployment logs:**
   - Look for: `✅ Storage path is writable - volume mount verified`
   - Watch for errors about storage not being writable

4. **Test persistence:**
   - Upload an image
   - Trigger a redeploy
   - Verify image still loads after redeploy

- `IMAGE_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md` - Detailed technical explanation
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- `IMAGE_PERSISTENCE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Key Takeaways

- Railway volumes need explicit VOLUME declarations in Dockerfile
- Named volumes in docker-compose ensure local persistence
- Startup verification helps catch mount issues early
- Good logging is critical for debugging production issues
