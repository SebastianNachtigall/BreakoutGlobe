# Avatar Display Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
Full account users could upload avatars successfully, but the avatars were not displayed on the map for the uploading user (though other users could see them).

## Root Causes

### 1. Authentication Issue (Fixed)
**Problem:** Backend handlers only checked `X-User-ID` header, but full accounts send JWT tokens.
**Solution:** Updated `UploadAvatar` and `UpdateProfile` handlers to check context first (for JWT auth) before falling back to header.

### 2. Missing AboutMe in Response (Fixed)
**Problem:** Avatar upload response didn't include the `aboutMe` field.
**Solution:** Added `AboutMe: user.AboutMe` to the upload response.

### 3. Profile Not Updating in UI (Fixed)
**Problem:** After upload, the profile store was updated but App.tsx wasn't re-rendering.
**Solution:** Added Zustand store subscription in App.tsx to listen for profile changes.

### 4. Preview State Not Clearing (Fixed)
**Problem:** AvatarImageUpload component kept showing preview instead of uploaded avatar.
**Solution:** Added useEffect to clear preview state when `currentAvatarUrl` changes.

### 5. Profile Not Loaded from Backend (Fixed - MAIN ISSUE)
**Problem:** When full account users logged in, their profile was created from localStorage auth data, which didn't include the latest avatar URL.
**Solution:** Modified App.tsx to fetch the complete profile from the backend after authentication, ensuring the latest avatar URL is loaded.

## Changes Made

### Backend
1. **`backend/internal/handlers/user_handler.go`**:
   - `UploadAvatar`: Check context for user ID (JWT auth) before header
   - `UpdateProfile`: Check context for user ID (JWT auth) before header
   - `UploadAvatar`: Include `AboutMe` field in response

### Frontend
1. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**:
   - Added Zustand store subscription to update local state when profile changes
   - Fetch full profile from backend for authenticated users on login
   - Added logging to track avatar URL propagation

2. **`frontend/src/components/AvatarImageUpload.tsx`**:
   - Clear preview state when `currentAvatarUrl` changes (successful upload)
   - Added logging to track currentAvatarUrl changes

3. **`frontend/src/components/ProfileSettingsModal.tsx`**:
   - Added detailed logging for avatar upload flow

4. **`frontend/src/components/AvatarMarker.tsx`**:
   - Added onLoad/onError handlers with logging

5. **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`**:
   - Added logging for avatar upload responses

6. **`frontend/src/stores/userProfileStore.ts`**:
   - Added avatarURL to setProfile logging

## Testing
- ✅ Full account users can upload avatars
- ✅ Avatars display immediately after upload in ProfileSettingsModal
- ✅ Avatars display on map for the uploading user
- ✅ Avatars display on map for other users
- ✅ Avatars persist after page refresh
- ✅ Guest users still work (backward compatible)

## How It Works Now

### Upload Flow
1. User uploads avatar via ProfileSettingsModal
2. Backend saves file and updates database
3. Response includes avatarURL
4. ProfileSettingsModal calls `userProfileStore.setProfile()`
5. App.tsx subscription triggers, updating local state
6. useMemo recalculates avatars array with new avatarURL
7. AvatarMarker renders with new image
8. AvatarImageUpload clears preview state

### Login Flow (Full Accounts)
1. User logs in, auth data saved to localStorage
2. App.tsx detects authenticated user
3. **NEW:** Fetches complete profile from backend (includes latest avatar)
4. Profile store updated with full data
5. Avatar displays on map immediately

## Database Verification
```sql
SELECT id, display_name, avatar_url FROM users WHERE account_type = 'full';
```

All full account users now have their avatars properly displayed!
